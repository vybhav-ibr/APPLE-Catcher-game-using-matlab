# Apple-Cather-game-using-matlab
Fun project 

## Work in Progress

The aim of this project is to make a playable game of APPLE catcher using the plot functions in matlab.
Apples fall from random locations and the basket is maved along the horizontal axis to the point where the apple will touch the base.

The basket is moved along the x-axis using a potentiometer which is connected to an arduino uno. Arduino hardware support package is used for this project. The input from the potentiometer is mapped to gives the required x coordinates and the bakset is plotted there accordingly.

There is no system to count how many apples were caught or missed, hence theere is no score keeping in this game(as of now).
The locations from whcih the apple falls can be predetermind and an array of all the starting x positions can be provided to the code. Or the code will generate random positions from which the apples fall.
